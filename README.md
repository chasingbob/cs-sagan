## Prerequisites

### Git basics

**Clone**

```
git clone https://github.com/chasingbob/cs-sagan.git
```


## Practical

### Python Basics

#### Data types

Data types are the basic building blocks you use to write complex programs. Python is not different.

```
x = 3
print(type(x)) # Prints "<class 'int'>"
print(x)       # Prints "3"
print(x + 1)   # Addition; prints "4"
print(x - 1)   # Subtraction; prints "2"
print(x * 2)   # Multiplication; prints "6"
print(x ** 2)  # Exponentiation; prints "9"
x += 1
print(x)  # Prints "4"
x *= 2
print(x)  # Prints "8"
y = 2.5
print(type(y)) # Prints "<class 'float'>"
print(y, y + 1, y * 2, y ** 2) # Prints "2.5 3.5 5.0 6.25"
```

## Theory work

### Section 1: Theory Fundamentals

** Week 1 ** 

- [ ] show understanding of the basis of different number systems and use the binary,
    denary and hexadecimal number system

- [ ] convert a number from one number system to another

- [ ] express a positive or negative integer in 2â€™s complement form

- [ ] show understanding of, and be able to represent, character data in its internal
binary form depending on the character set used (Candidates will not be expected to
memorise any particular character codes but must be familiar with ASCII and
Unicode.)

- [ ] express a denary number in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) and vice versa

- [ ] describe practical applications where BCD is use
